Encapsulation

Definition

Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which helps prevent accidental modifications.

Key Learnings

Data Protection: Encapsulation ensures that sensitive data is hidden from external access, reducing unintended interference.

Controlled Access: Getters and setters allow controlled interaction with private attributes.

Improved Maintainability: By hiding the implementation details, changes to the class do not impact external code.

Encapsulation in Real-World Applications: Used in database management, APIs, and frameworks to safeguard data integrity.

Polymorphism

Definition

Polymorphism allows a single interface to be used for different types. It enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class while maintaining their specific behaviors.

Key Learnings

Method Overriding: A subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

Method Overloading: Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters can coexist in the same class.

Flexibility and Scalability: Code can work with different object types seamlessly, improving reusability and extensibility.

Real-World Use Cases: Found in GUI frameworks, machine learning models, and various design patterns to support dynamic behavior.
