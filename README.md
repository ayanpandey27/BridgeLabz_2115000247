Used polymorphism to call makeSound() dynamically. Employee Management System Implemented Employee as a superclass and subclasses: Manager, Developer, and Intern. Introduced attributes like teamSize (for Manager) and programmingLanguage (for Developer). Overrode displayDetails() to show unique employee information. Vehicle Management System (Hybrid Inheritance) Created a Vehicle superclass with maxSpeed and fuelType. Implemented ElectricVehicle and PetrolVehicle as subclasses. Created an interface Refuelable, which PetrolVehicle implements. Demonstrated hybrid inheritance by making PetrolVehicle extend Vehicle while implementing Refuelable. Library Management System Designed a Book superclass and an Author subclass. Overrode displayInfo() to print book and author details. Smart Home System Created a Device superclass with deviceId and status. Implemented Thermostat as a subclass with temperatureSetting. Overrode displayStatus() to display unique device information. Restaurant System (Hybrid Inheritance) Created a Person superclass. Defined a Worker interface with a performDuties() method. Implemented Chef and Waiter subclasses that inherit from Person and implement Worker, showcasing multiple inheritance through interfaces.

On this day, I delved into advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java, with a focus on inheritance, polymorphism, and hybrid inheritance. I implemented several practical applications to reinforce these concepts. Activities and Implementations: Animal Hierarchy: Created an Animal superclass with makeSound() method. Implemented subclasses: Dog, Cat, and Bird. Demonstrated method overriding by overriding makeSound() in each subclass. Used polymorphism to call makeSound() dynamically. Employee Management System: Created an Employee superclass and subclasses: Manager, Developer, and Intern. Added attributes like teamSize for Manager and programmingLanguage for Developer. Overrode displayDetails() to showcase unique employee information. Vehicle Management System (Hybrid Inheritance): Designed a Vehicle superclass with maxSpeed and fuelType. Implemented ElectricVehicle and PetrolVehicle as subclasses. Created an interface Refuelable, implemented by PetrolVehicle. Demonstrated hybrid inheritance: PetrolVehicle extends Vehicle and implements Refuelable. Library Management System: Created a Book superclass and an Author subclass. Overrode displayInfo() to print book and author details. Smart Home System: Created a Device superclass with deviceId and status. Implemented a Thermostat subclass with temperatureSetting.

Data Structure-Based Management Systems This project collection includes various management systems implemented using linked lists (Singly, Doubly, and Circular) in Java. Each system is designed for efficient data handling and operations.

Singly Linked List: Student Records Management A system to manage student records, allowing addition, deletion, searching, updating, and displaying student data. Doubly Linked List: Movie Management System A movie database that supports insertion, deletion, searching by director/rating, and displaying movies in both forward and reverse order. Circular Linked List: Task Scheduler A scheduler that organizes tasks, allowing task insertion, deletion, searching, and circular traversal for continuous scheduling. Singly Linked List: Inventory Management System Manages an inventory by adding, removing, updating, searching items, calculating total inventory value, and sorting based on name or price. Doubly Linked List: Library Management System A system to manage books by adding, removing, searching, updating availability, counting books, and displaying data in both orders. Circular Linked List: Round Robin CPU Scheduling Simulates a round-robin CPU scheduling algorithm, managing process execution based on a fixed time quantum and calculating performance metrics. Singly Linked List: Social Media Friend Connections Handles friend connections, mutual friends, searching users, and counting friends using a linked list-based structure. Doubly Linked List: Undo/Redo in Text Editor Implements an undo/redo functionality where each state of text is stored, allowing navigation through previous and next versions.
